The Career of a Python Developer:
	Python Careers:
		Software Engineer:
			it's a person that built sofware/programs, so code to solve real world problems
			if you want to work for maybe Google, Netflix.. you might apply to become a software engineer
				and so use python in the coding interviews to solve coding problems and get the job
		
		Python Developer:
			that's a very generic term but a python dev. is essentially somebody that solves problems
				of a company with Python 
		
		Research Analyst:
			it's a somebody like a scientific who use python to analyze his laboratory's data
		
		Data Analyst:
			they use whatever data that a company has and analyze it to make buisness decisions
		
		Data Scientist:
			they can do what most data analyst do but
				they also have really strong mathematical, statistical and programming background
					in order to create algorithms and new models
		Backend/Web Developer:
			can use tools like Django, Flask to build web applications, API services, etc
		Testing/Automation:
			can be as simple as testing a website/webapp, testing a mobile app,
				writing python scripts to simulate user behaviors and test that a company's product works
		Machine Learning Expert:
			that creates ML models from lots and lots of data, 
				models that can predict or create something useful for a company
		
		
	What if i don't have enough experience:
		keep in mind that job postings are put in order to weed out the weak candidates
			by just making job sound harder, 
				tougher than it really is in order to remove junior developpers from applying
				
		ask yourself is this job going to be tough ?
			because if you apply to something that you're 100% qualified for, where is the room to grow ?
	
		how can you have good experience if you're just getting started ?
			as with everything there's the regular way and 
				there's the smart way : 
					you see, experience doesn't come just from working at a company
					there's many ways to demonstrate experience without a past job
						and it's by : github, website, big projects, blog
		
		Getting the interview:
			GitHub:
				it's a great way to show that you actually code, that you have built projects
					ways to improve github profile or to just add more experience is:
						first: (start to) make a lot of commits (to get a good history of your work)
						last: contribute, participate as you can less or more in open source projects

			Website:
				if you're a web dev, it's good to have your own website where to showcase your skills
				this is something to speak about in interview and maybe why not how you built it
				
				however, keep in mind that you don't need to build the webiste from scratch
					there's a ton of free templates/ressources that can be use like with:
						create-tim.com
						mashup-template.com
					take example of : rocketgirl.herokuapp.com
				
			1-2 Big Projects:
				having something like 1 big project make you sound more impressive 
					than somebody that just built a ton of tiny projects
				if you have no work experience, talk about these 1-2 big projects
					on the work experience part in the resume
			Blog:
				another thing you can add to your resume,
					especially if it's related to a technology you or the company are using
				Medium: 
					medium.com allows anybody to just post a blog post
					it also allows to push an article to a specific popular publishers to get more readers
					so create an account on it and start posting
			
		Talk about your portfolio projects, maybe talk about your website and how you built it,
		talk about maybe a hackathon you participate or open source projects you have worked on
		write a blog post on a specific technology that the company you're applying to is using
		
			all of that answer this question: do you have experience ?
			
		also know there's many things that you can add that are not developper
			but that can make you a great employee
				so if you have them, you can add skills like:
					the ability to manage people and communicate with others
		so know that any skill that is related to getting the job can be included
		
		'i have only 6 months / 1 year of coding experience': never show things like that on your resume
		
		
	Now what ?
		Where to Run Python:
			we can run Python in laptop, desktop, servers, mobile, on any OS
				as we have the Python Interpreter and obviously at least one python file

			Any General Scripting Purpose
			Email, SMS, Twitter Bots
			File Processing (excel, pdf..)
			Image Processing
			Automation
			Data Scraping
			Data Visualization
