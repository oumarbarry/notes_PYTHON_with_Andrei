What is a programming language ?
	programming is just a way for human to give instructions to computers
	machines speak binary language,
	so humans created programming language that is between human language and machines language
	
	programming language is higher level if closer to human language,
	so is lower level if closer to machines language like assembly
	
	so in order to translate the source code, we need interpreter/compiler
	interpreter runs the code line by line
	compiler take all the code at once and give as ouput an binary excecutable file
	
	programming language is just a set of instructions that can be give to an translator to translate them in binary code, in order to runs machine, to give them right instructions
	
Python Interpreter:
	We have Python, the language
	but as interpreter we have:
		cpython: so python interpreter written in c //those you download at python.org
		jython: written in java
		pypy: written in python
		iron python: written for .net
		
	so the cpython interpreter runs our source code and generate bytecode that is closer to machine code,
	then it's use the cpythonVM that run bytecode, to generate binary code
	and then this code gets run on our machine

How to run python code:
	Terminal
	Code editors: Sublime Text, VS Code
	IDEs: Pycharm, Spyder
	Notebooks: Jyputer
	
	Online tools: like repl.it, glot.io

Python 2 vs Python 3:
	python comes in 1990-1
	in 2008, breaking update has been made by guido, that would change some things that he no longer like in the language/interpreter
	then comes python 3, but the key difference between python 2.x and python 3.x are not big
	in 2020, python will no longer be supported
