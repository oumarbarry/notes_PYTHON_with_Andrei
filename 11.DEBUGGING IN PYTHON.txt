Debugging in Python:
	How to debug code:
		The act of finding and removing bugs, errors, exceptions from our code is called debugging
		
		WAY to debug more efficiently:
			linting: that can be provide by pylint
				PyCharm has already built-in linting
				we can install pylint for code editor like vscode
			
			IDEs, LEARNING TO READ ERRORS
			
			print function: is also a really quick and easy way to debug our code
			
			Python Debugger (PDB): a built-in python module
				pdb is extremely useful because it allows us to interact with the code
				
				import pdb
				
				def add(num1, num2):
					pdb.set_trace() #this line will lauch the pdb interactive shell, type 'help' for documentation
					return num1+num2
	
				add(4,5)
